# Complement-Creator-for-Technical-Enchant-Renewed

TE+ Complement Creator V1.1.0 for TE+ Renewed version 7.2.2
===GREETINGS!=================================================================

This application, made by Kendall Payton(Ziromanean#3173 on discord), 
is for the creation of custom complements to the "Technical Enchant+ Renewed"! Datapack (created by Frektip)
In this app, you can add many different items and blocks to the datapacks' functionality
and is intended to add mod support to TE+ Renewed by allowing the user to add whatever items they choose.

To run this software, open the "TE+ Datapack Creator.exe" file.
When you're finished adding items, press the "Build" button at the bottom left to create a complement.
This zip file will be saved to the desktop.


Below is a list of the types of items that can be added thus far:
=================================================================
   * Wood Blocks
   * Stone Blocks
   * Swords, Tridents, Bows, Crossbows, Shields
   * Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Hoes, Fishing Rods
   * Custom Items
   * Armor Sets

THINGS TO ADD
==================================================================================================================================================================================
   * Add Custom Items To Preset Functionality
   * App Size Scaling

(CUSTOM ITEMS)
=========================================================================================
In the Tools Tab, you'll notice a section labeled "Custom Item ID:"
This is where you can add modded items that fall under more than one category of tool. For example, some mods have tools that 
combine Pickaxes, Axes, and Shovels called a "Paxel".
Like the other Item ID boxes, enter the full item id in the textbox.

In the "Type" section, enter the type of tool it is that is being added.

Finally, the "Item Interactions" section is where you can select the kind of tool types that apply to the tool you are adding. 
Be sure to select at least one, or it won't be added.

(Full Example):
   ID - gobber2:gobber2_paxel_nether,
   Type - paxel,
   Interactions - (Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel)

(ARMOR)
=========================================================================================
In the Armor Tab, both the chestplate and boots have some extra features.
Both allow for the user to specify the amount of basic Armor, Armor Toughness, and Knockback Resistance. These values are applied to the item only AFTER the 
Life Plus or Agility enchantment is added to the armor pieces.

Toughness and Armor are measured in whole numbers while Knockback is measured as a decimal (ex. 0.4), and if nothing is inputted, will default to 0.0

(Technically you can make this value whatever you wish, but bugs may occur, so perform at your own risk!)
